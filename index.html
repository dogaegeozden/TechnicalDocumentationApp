        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
        <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
            <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Disqus or Facebook.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
        <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>You may have to start small, and progress gradually.</p>
        <li>To begin, let's open the browser console and enter the following code</li>
        <code>console.log("Hello World!")</code>

        <p>To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, let's explain some of the core features of the language. It's worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages. If you master these fundamentals, you have a head start on coding in other languages too!</p>
        <p>Variables are containers that store values.</p>
        <li>You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</li>
        <code>let myVariable;</code>
        <code>let x;</code>
        <code>let y;</code>
        <code>let z;</code>
